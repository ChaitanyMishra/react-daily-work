# 🚀 React Daily Projects by Chaitany Mishra

Welcome to my **React learning repository**, a growing collection of hands-on projects and implementations where I explore React fundamentals, build intuitive UIs, and master real-world developer workflows.

## 📘 About This Repository

This repository is a **living archive** of my journey to become a proficient **Full Stack Developer** with a strong React foundation. My long-term vision is to work at high-growth startups or mid-size product-based companies with a focus on performance, scalability, and UI/UX excellence.

Here, I practice:

* 🛠️ Core React concepts (components, props, state, hooks)
* ⚛️ Custom React logic and reusable UI components
* 🌐 Integrating APIs and managing side effects
* 🧱 Building responsive layouts with clean CSS / Tailwind
* ⛓️ Version control best practices using Git and GitHub

This is **not** a tutorial repo — it’s my sandbox for exploration and creativity.
