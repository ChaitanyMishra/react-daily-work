# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🧪 React Core Lab

Welcome to **React Core Lab** — a dedicated practice space designed to help me master React fundamentals through hands-on exploration. This repository is tailored to document what I’ve learned as I build a strong foundation in React by focusing on one concept at a time.

---

## 📚 What I've Learned So Far

- JSX and Virtual DOM fundamentals
- Functional components and props
- useState, useEffect, and controlled inputs
- Event handling and conditional rendering
- List rendering, forms, and basic hooks
- Creating custom hooks and reusable logic

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChaitanyMishra/react-core-lab.git
cd react-core-lab
npm install
npm start
```

> Each concept is organized as a separate folder for modular learning.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The objective of this lab is to break down React into digestible parts, giving me clear examples I can understand, run, and tweak. This is not a tutorial repo — it's a **self-guided learning lab**.

---

## 🔐 Git & Environment Notes

- `.env`, `node_modules`, and `build/` are ignored via `.gitignore`
- Clean commits with descriptive messages are used to track progress
- Environment-specific files are kept out of version control for security

---

## 📬 Feedback & Contributions

This is a personal learning repository. Fork freely, clone it, and adapt it to your own React journey. Suggestions are welcome through GitHub issues.
