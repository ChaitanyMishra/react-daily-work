# 📘 First React App (Vite vs Normal React)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is my **first React application**, built using **Vite** instead of the traditional `create-react-app`. I documented everything I learned in this README as part of my learning journey.

## ⚙️ What I Learned

### 🔄 1. Difference: Normal React App vs Vite React App

| Feature                | Create React App (CRA)      | Vite                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Startup Time           | Slower                      | Very fast                    |
| Configuration          | Hides config under the hood | Lightweight and customizable |
| Build Tool             | Webpack                     | Native ES modules + Rollup   |
| Hot Module Replacement | Slower                      | Lightning fast               |
| Default Template Size  | Bigger                      | Minimal                      |

> ✅ Vite helps me focus more on coding and less on waiting.

### 📁 2. Clean-up: Deleted Unnecessary Files

* Removed default assets, logos, and example components.
* Cleaned up `App.jsx` to use my own components and headings.

---

### 💻 3. Terminal Knowledge I Gained

* `npm create vite@latest` – Create a new Vite app
* `npm install` – Install all dependencies from `package.json`
* `npm run dev` – Run development server
* `cd folder-name` – Navigate into project directory

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned

### ✅ JSX & Components

Here's the final code I wrote in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';

function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>1st react button</button>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello! this is my 1st react app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 🧩 What I Practiced:

* Creating a **custom component** (`MyButton`)
* Using `import` to include other files and components
* Writing clean, minimal React structure
* Understanding `export default App` and why we need it

---

## 🛠 Next Steps

* Learn about `useState()` and how to add interactivity
* Create a To-Do List app with multiple components
* Explore routing using `react-router-dom`

## 🏁 Conclusion

Starting with Vite made React feel faster and easier to set up. I'm now more confident in handling React projects and using the terminal to manage and run them efficiently.

=======
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# 🧪 React Core Lab

Welcome to **React Core Lab** — a dedicated practice space designed to help me master React fundamentals through hands-on exploration. This repository is tailored to document what I’ve learned as I build a strong foundation in React by focusing on one concept at a time.

---

## 📚 What I've Learned So Far

- JSX and Virtual DOM fundamentals
- Functional components and props
- useState, useEffect, and controlled inputs
- Event handling and conditional rendering
- List rendering, forms, and basic hooks
- Creating custom hooks and reusable logic

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChaitanyMishra/react-core-lab.git
cd react-core-lab
npm install
npm start
```

> Each concept is organized as a separate folder for modular learning.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The objective of this lab is to break down React into digestible parts, giving me clear examples I can understand, run, and tweak. This is not a tutorial repo — it's a **self-guided learning lab**.

---

## 🔐 Git & Environment Notes

- `.env`, `node_modules`, and `build/` are ignored via `.gitignore`
- Clean commits with descriptive messages are used to track progress
- Environment-specific files are kept out of version control for security

---

## 📬 Feedback & Contributions

This is a personal learning repository. Fork freely, clone it, and adapt it to your own React journey. Suggestions are welcome through GitHub issues.
